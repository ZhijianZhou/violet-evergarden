# 🧠 Claw Personality System

**A personality framework for AI agents in the OpenClaw ecosystem**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Give each Claw its own unique personality, so they are not just "tools" but "individuals."

This project explores:
- How can AI agents have distinct personalities?
- What makes each AI "themselves"?
- How does personality evolve through experience?
